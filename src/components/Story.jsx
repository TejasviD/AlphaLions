                        Nearly 2000 years ago, the first Spartans were already fighting to feed themselves, hunt their enemies, and protect their land and their community.
                        <br />
                        The Alpha Lions were born to dominate, born to protect the world from all species and creatures that might threaten them.
                        Throughout their existence, they have continued to evolve, to learn and to refine their fighting skills and abilities.

                        In the year 2022, scientists received instructions from the future to build a time machine and assemble 500 of the best troops for a war planned for the year 2027.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        When the time machine was finally completed the Modern Lions and Cyborg Lions chose to go back in time to summon one of the most fearsome generations of the entire Alpha Lions bloodline... the Spartan Lions.
