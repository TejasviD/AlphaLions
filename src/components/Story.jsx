                        All Stars Club Bunny came out of his burrow and saw a Private Jet in the sky.
                        Since then, he got so fascinated that he worked hard every single day to get his own one in the future.
                        Later on, he moved to the City of Angels and he went all-in on cryptocurrencies. After some huge successes he quickly became a billionaire.

                    In L.A. he lived all his dreams, from driving the finest cars, and wearing designer clothes to meeting the most attractive female bunnies
                    and being surrounded by the most famous people. He even got his own Private Jet to travel around the world now!
                    Therefore, he created All Stars Club so he can share his exceptional lifestyle with the young bunnies that have the same dream he had when
                    they look at the All Stars Club's Private Jet today.
